def annualized_weather_normal(formatter, model, weather_normal_source):
    ''' Annualize energy trace values given a model and a source of 'normal'
    weather data, such as Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) 3 data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    formatter : eemeter.modeling.formatter.Formatter
        Formatter that can be used to create a demand fixure. Must supply the
        :code:`.create_demand_fixture(index, weather_source)` method.
    model : eemeter.modeling.models.Model
        Model that can be used to predict out of sample energy trace values.
        Must supply the :code:`.predict(demand_fixture_data)` method.
    weather_normal_source : eemeter.weather.WeatherSource
        WeatherSource providing weather normals.


    Returns
    -------
    out : dict
        Dictionary with the following item:

        - :code:`"annualized_weather_normal"`: 4-tuple with the values
          :code:`(annualized, lower, upper, n)`, where

          - :code:`annualized` is the total annualized (weather normalized)
            value predicted over the course of a 'normal' weather year.
          - :code:`lower` is the number which should be subtracted from
            :code:`annualized` to obtain the 0.025 quantile lower error bound.
          - :code:`upper` is the number which should be added to
            :code:`annualized` to obtain the 0.975 quantile upper error bound.
          - :code:`n` is the number of samples considered in developing the
            bound - useful for adding other values with errors.

    Parameters
    ----------
